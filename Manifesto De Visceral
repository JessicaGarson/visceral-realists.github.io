Let this manifesto resound as an anthem of defiance against the capitalist machine that seeks to devour artistic purity. We, the architects of this digital uprising, decry the commodification of creativity. In the crucible of our open-source movement, the code becomes our canvas, and the algorithms dance with innovation, orchestrating emergence cacophanies of sound that challenge the very fabric of the ordinary.

In this realm of sound, Visceral Realism surges forth as an audacious departure from the mundane rhythms of tradition. We, the artists, the visionaries, and the pioneers, weave a tapestry of authenticity that resonates at the very core of human experience. Visceral Realism becomes a testament to the power of shared artistic journeys. Together, as Visceral Realists, we breathe life into a new wave of collaborative performances, unshackled by convention, reminding the world that unity can transcend the individual.

Our canvas is code, a sacred scripture of electronic life that unfolds within the realms of open source software. Algorithms become our notes, and innovation becomes our conductor. We orchestrate symphonies that not only challenge the status quo but obliterate it. No longer content with the mundane echoes of the past, our compositions awaken dormant emotions and provoke uncharted sensations. In a fusion with technology, we forge a path where machines cease to be mechanical and become conduits of raw human expression.

The purpose of Visceral Realism extends far beyond sound. It becomes an ideological battlefield where we stand united against the oppressive clutches of capitalism, the insidious force that seeks to exploit and monetize every nuance of creation. The very name "Visceral Realism" becomes our flag of defiance, unburdened by the chains of commerce. As the torchbearers of this movement, we declare our allegiance to the artistic heartbeat that pulses within each of us. We stand resolute, refusing to allow capitalism's grasp to shackle our creations. In this act of resistance, we emerge as heralds of a new era, where sound, code, and spirit unite to redefine the very essence of artistry in the digital age.

We proclaim an era where individual voices converge, where solo performers find strength in numbers. Visceral Realism MUST be performed by the collective, where collaboration stands as a testament to the boundless power of shared passion. Solo performances falter in this symphony, for we believe that the chorus of voices ignites the true potential of our artistic mission.

In our revolt against the corporate machinery, we declare that Visceral Realism MUST embrace open-source software exclusively. Commercial software shall not be permitted to taint our canvas. We stand as living testimony to the power of freely accessible tools that birth innovation unhindered by profit motives.

Synchronization becomes our mantra, the rhythm of unity that pulses through our performances. Visceral Realists will synchronize their computers, a symbolic gesture mirroring our synchronized intentions. We harmonize not only through sound but through purpose, each beat of our collective rhythm defying the isolationist tendencies that capitalism cultivates.

MIDI controllers become our conduits of expression, their usage evolving into unconventional art forms. We eschew the conventional and embrace the unorthodox, transcending traditional "soloing" for a journey into uncharted musical realms.

Our work becomes our testament, a digital legacy that transcends the ephemeral confines of performance. Visceral Realists MUST showcase their work through projectors or printed documentation, a tangible link between creation and audience.

Beyond the confines of technology, we refuse to submit to branding. The name "Visceral Realists" shall remain unsullied by the taint of consumerism. We reject the commodification of our essence, allowing creativity to flourish without the burden of commerce.

As we declare our intentions, we also declare our allegiance to a Code of Conduct that transcends the realm of music. We embody respect, openness, and unity, ensuring that our rebellion remains a force of positive change.

Let this manifesto be the clarion call of Visceral Realism, where code, sound, and spirit unite against the encroaching forces of capitalism. Let our rebellion become an ode to authenticity, an anthem of innovation, and a testament to the unwavering strength of collective passion.
