The first performance of modern Visceral Realism occurred August 15th, 2023 at
Record Shop in the Red Hook neighborhood of South Brooklyn. Performing Visceral
Realists were Andy Borsz and Zona Zanjeros. Notably in attendance was Peter
Whitney of Jaguar Psychosis. The performance was arguably a failure due to
technical difficulties with the venue's PA system. Both Zanjeros and Borsz
performed using the open source Haskell library Tidal Cycles; Zanjeros
splattering plunderphonic death metal samples and effects while Borsz live
looped styrofoam and an electric meat carving blade. Very little worked
correctly, and some resorted to shit-talk.
